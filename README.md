# BiA-PoL taurus tools
Collection of tools to work on Bio-image Analysis tools on the [taurus cluster of TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/hpc?set_language=en).

Before you can start working on the taurus cluster, you need to file a [project request](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/hpc?set_language=en#section-1).

## ProjectFileTransfer
If you own a project space on taurus and want to transfer files to it, you can ask [HPC support](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/support) to enable a connection to your fileserver.
Afterwards, you can use [TUD ZIH datamover](https://doc.zih.tu-dresden.de/data_transfer/datamover/) to transfer files from the fileserver to the cluster. If you want to do this conveniently from python,
see the [ProjectFileTransfer demo]().
